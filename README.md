# Pokemon-Online-Scripts
---
Scripts I've coded to be used with the Pokemon Online application.

# Using Scripts
---
There are 3 types of scripts. Battle, Client and Server.
* Battle - Scripts that perform in the battle window.
* Client - Scripts that perform, from the client user's alt, in chat channels.
* Server - Scripts that performs mostly overall on the server.

The instrucitons how to set up a script can be found in the folder directory.

# Contributing

Any helpful code improvements or additions are always welcome. These are the following coding standards I use:
* Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
* The use of JSHint and/or JSLint is encouraged for code neatness and error free.

Setting Tabs Correct on Notepad Plus Plus
* Settings >> Preferencesâ€¦ >> Tab Settings >> javascript
* Use default value: unchecked
* Tab size: 4
* Replace by space: checked

# Disclaimer
The scripts are mostly written by me and shouldn't contain any errors that will harm your computer or client in any way. The only worse case of a missed bug will just crash your client, nothing more. But I've taken care to avoid any problems occurring at all. Your use and edits of the scripts is at your own risk.
